# Python CLI

The base template for a Python CLI project. It uses [Boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr) as a template manager:
```
# Save template
boilr template save . python-cli -f

# Use template
boilr template use python-cli cli
```

## Dependency Management
The Python CLI project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as its dependency manager, mainly because of clean CLI and top-notch dependency resolver abilities - refer to Poetry's website for more info. Here's a couple commands that you might find useful:
